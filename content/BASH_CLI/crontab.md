## Maintain crontab files for individual users

CRONTAB(1)                 General Commands Manual                 CRONTAB(1)

NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [ -u user ] file
       crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }

DESCRIPTION
       crontab  is  the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables
       used to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each  user  can  have
       their    own    crontab,    and    though    these    are   files   in
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.

       If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one  user
       per  line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command.  If the
       /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny  file  does
       exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order
       to use this command.
    
       If neither of these files exists,  then  depending  on  site-dependent
       configuration  parameters,  only the super user will be allowed to use
       this command, or all users will be able to use this command.
    
       If both files exist  then  /etc/cron.allow  takes  precedence.   Which
       means  that  /etc/cron.deny  is  not  considered and your user must be
       listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab.
    
       Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the  root  adminis‐
       trative  user  is always allowed to setup a crontab.  For standard De‐
       bian systems, all users may use this command.
    
       If the -u option is given, it specifies the name  of  the  user  whose
       crontab  is  to be used (when listing) or modified (when editing).  If
       this option is not given, crontab examines "your" crontab,  i.e.,  the
       crontab of the person executing the command.  Note that su(8) can con‐
       fuse crontab and that if you are running inside of  su(8)  you  should
       always use the -u option for safety's sake.
    
       The  first  form of this command is used to install a new crontab from
       some named file or standard input  if  the  pseudo-filename  ``-''  is
       given.
    
       The  -l  option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard
       output.  See the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.
    
       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.
    
       The -e option is used to edit the current  crontab  using  the  editor
       specified  by  the  VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.  After you
       exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automati‐
       cally.   If  neither of the environment variables is defined, then the
       default editor /usr/bin/editor is used.
    
       The -i option modifies the -r option to prompt the user  for  a  'y/Y'
       response before actually removing the crontab.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       The  "out-of-the-box" behaviour for crontab -l is to display the three
       line "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header that is placed at the beginning of
       the  crontab  when  it is installed.  The problem is that it makes the
       sequence

       crontab -l | crontab -
    
       non-idempotent — you keep adding copies of the  header.   This  causes
       pain  to  scripts  that use sed to edit a crontab.  Therefore, the de‐
       fault behaviour of the -l option has been changed to not  output  such
       header.  You may obtain the original behaviour by setting the environ‐
       ment variable CRONTAB_NOHEADER to 'N', which will cause the crontab -l
       command to emit the extraneous header.

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs

       The  files  /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny if, they exist, must be
       either world-readable, or readable by group ``crontab''. If  they  are
       not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are
       fixed.
    
       There   is   one   file   for   each   user's   crontab   under    the
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory.  Users are not allowed to edit the
       files under that directory directly to ensure that only users  allowed
       by  the  system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntacti‐
       cally correct crontabs will be written there.   This  is  enforced  by
       having  the directory writable only by the crontab group and configur‐
       ing crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This
       new  command  syntax  differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as
       well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it  with  a  bad
       command line.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character.
       If the last entry in a crontab is missing the newline, cron will  con‐
       sider  the  crontab  (at least partially) broken and refuse to install
       it.
    
       The files under /var/spool/cron/crontabs are named based on the user's
       account  name.   Crontab jobs will not be run for users whose accounts
       have been renamed either due to changes in the local system or because
       they are managed through a central user database (external to the sys‐
       tem, for example an LDAP directory).

NAME
       crontab - tables for driving cron

DESCRIPTION
       A crontab file contains instructions to the cron(8) daemon of the gen‐
       eral form: ``run this command at this time on this date''.  Each  user
       has  their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be exe‐
       cuted as the user who owns the crontab.  Uucp and  News  will  usually
       have  their  own crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running
       su(1) as part of a cron command.

       Blank lines and leading spaces and  tabs  are  ignored.   Lines  whose
       first non-space character is a hash-sign (#) are comments, and are ig‐
       nored.  Note that comments are not allowed on the same  line  as  cron
       commands,  since  they will be taken to be part of the command.  Simi‐
       larly, comments are not allowed on the same line as environment  vari‐
       able settings.
    
       An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a
       cron command.  The crontab file is parsed from top to bottom,  so  any
       environment  settings will affect only the cron commands below them in
       the file.  An environment setting is of the form,
    
           name = value
    
       where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any  sub‐
       sequent non-leading spaces in value will be part of the value assigned
       to name.  The value string may be placed in quotes (single or  double,
       but  matching)  to  preserve leading or trailing blanks.  To define an
       empty variable, quotes must be used.
    
       The value string is not parsed for environmental substitutions or  re‐
       placement of variables or tilde(~) expansion, thus lines like
    
           PATH = $HOME/bin:$PATH
           PATH = ~/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    
       will not work as you might expect. And neither will this work
    
           A=1
           B=2
           C=$A $B
    
       There  will  not  be any substitution for the defined variables in the
       last value.
    
       Several environment variables are set up automatically by the  cron(8)
       daemon.   SHELL  is  set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from
       the  /etc/passwd  line  of  the  crontab's  owner.   PATH  is  set  to
       "/usr/bin:/bin".   HOME, SHELL, and PATH may be overridden by settings
       in the crontab; LOGNAME is the user that the job is running from,  and
       may not be changed.
    
       (Another  note:  the  LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD
       systems...  on these systems, USER will be set also.)
    
       In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, cron(8) will look  at  MAILTO
       if  it  has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in
       ``this'' crontab.  If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail is  sent
       to  the user so named.  MAILTO may also be used to direct mail to mul‐
       tiple recipients by separating  recipient  users  with  a  comma.   If
       MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent.  Other‐
       wise mail is sent to the owner of the crontab.
    
       On the Debian GNU/Linux system, cron supports the pam_env module,  and
       loads  the  environment  specified  by /etc/environment and /etc/secu‐
       rity/pam_env.conf.  It also reads  locale  information  from  /etc/de‐
       fault/locale.   However, the PAM settings do NOT override the settings
       described above nor any settings in the crontab file itself.  Note  in
       particular  that  if  you  want a PATH other than "/usr/bin:/bin", you
       will need to set it in the crontab file.
    
       By default, cron will send mail using the mail "Content-Type:"  header
       of  "text/plain"  with  the  "charset=" parameter set to the charmap /
       codeset of the locale in which crond(8) is started up  –  i.e.  either
       the  default  system locale, if no LC_* environment variables are set,
       or the locale specified by the LC_* environment variables  (  see  lo‐
       cale(7)).   You  can use different character encodings for mailed cron
       job output by setting the CONTENT_TYPE  and  CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING
       variables  in  crontabs,  to the correct values of the mail headers of
       those names.
    
       The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a num‐
       ber of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five time and date
       fields, followed by a command, followed by a newline character ('\n').
       The  system  crontab  (/etc/crontab) uses the same format, except that
       the username for the command is specified  after  the  time  and  date
       fields  and before the command.  The fields may be separated by spaces
       or tabs.  The maximum permitted length for the command  field  is  998
       characters.
    
       Commands  are  executed by cron(8) when the minute, hour, and month of
       year fields match the current time, and when at least one of  the  two
       day  fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current time (see
       ``Note'' below).  cron(8) examines cron  entries  once  every  minute.
       The time and date fields are:
    
              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0–59
              hour           0–23
              day of month   1–31
              month          1–12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0–7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
    
       A   field   may   be   an   asterisk  (*),  which  always  stands  for
       ``first-last''.
    
       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated  with
       a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8–11 for an
       ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.
    
       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or  ranges)  separated
       by commas.  Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0–4,8–12''.
    
       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range
       with ``/<number>'' specifies skips of the number's value  through  the
       range.   For  example,  ``0–23/2''  can  be used in the hours field to
       specify command execution every other hour (the alternative in the  V7
       standard  is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').  Steps are also per‐
       mitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every  two  hours'',
       just use ``*/2''.
    
       Names  can  also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week'' fields.
       Use the first three letters of  the  particular  day  or  month  (case
       doesn't matter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.
    
       The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be
       run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to  a  newline  or  %
       character,  will  be  executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in
       the SHELL variable of the crontab file.  Percent-signs (%) in the com‐
       mand,  unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline
       characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command
       as  standard  input.   There  is no way to split a single command line
       onto multiple lines, like the shell's trailing "\".
    
       Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two  fields
       — day of month, and day of week.  If both fields are restricted (i.e.,
       don't start with *), the command will be run when either field matches
       the current time.  For example,
       ``30  4  1,15  * 5'' would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the
       1st and 15th of each month, plus  every  Friday.   One  can,  however,
       achieve  the  desired  result by adding a test to the command (see the
       last example in EXAMPLE CRON FILE below).
    
       Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may ap‐
       pear:
    
              string         meaning
              ------         -------
              @reboot        Run once, at startup.
              @yearly        Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
              @annually      (same as @yearly)
              @monthly       Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
              @weekly        Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
              @daily         Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
              @midnight      (same as @daily)
              @hourly        Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".
    
       Please  note that startup, as far as @reboot is concerned, is the time
       when the cron(8) daemon startup.  In particular, it may be before some
       system daemons, or other facilities, were startup.  This is due to the
       boot order sequence of the machine.

EXAMPLE CRON FILE
       The following lists an example of a user crontab file.

       # use /bin/bash to run commands, instead of the default /bin/sh
       SHELL=/bin/bash
       # mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
       MAILTO=paul
       #
       # run five minutes after midnight, every day
       5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
       # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month — output mailed to paul
       15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
       # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
       0 22 * * 1–5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
       23 0–23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
       5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every Sunday"
       0 */4 1 * mon   echo "run every 4th hour on the 1st and on every Monday"
       0 0 */2 * sun   echo "run at midn on every Sunday that's an uneven date"
       # Run on every second Saturday of the month
       0 4 8–14 * *    test $(date +\%u) -eq 6 && echo "2nd Saturday"
    
       All the above examples run non-interactive programs.  If you  wish  to
       run  a program that interacts with the user's desktop you have to make
       sure the proper environment variable DISPLAY is set.
    
       # Execute a program and run a notification every day at 10:00 am
       0 10 * * *  $HOME/bin/program | DISPLAY=:0 notify-send "Program run" "$(cat)"

EXAMPLE SYSTEM CRON FILE
       The following lists the content of a regular system-wide crontab file.
       Unlike  a user's crontab, this file has the username field, as used by
       /etc/crontab.

       # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
       # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
       # command to install the new version when you edit this file
       # and files in /etc/cron.d.  These files also have username fields,
       # that none of the other crontabs do.
    
       SHELL=/bin/sh
       PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    
       # Example of job definition:
       # .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
       # |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
       # |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
       # |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
       # |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
       # |  |  |  |  |
       # m h dom mon dow usercommand
       17 * * * *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
       25 6 * * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
       47 6 * * 7  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
       52 6 1 * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
       #
    
       Note that all the system-wide tasks will run, by default, from 6 am to
       7  am.  In the case of systems that are not powered on during that pe‐
       riod of time, only the hourly tasks will be executed  unless  the  de‐
       faults above are changed.

EXTENSIONS
       When  specifying  day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be considered
       Sunday.  BSD and AT&T seem to disagree about this.

       Lists and ranges are allowed to co-exist in the same field.  "1–3,7–9"
       would  be  rejected  by  AT&T  or BSD cron — they want to see "1–3" or
       "7,8,9" ONLY.
    
       Ranges can include "steps", so "1–9/2" is the same as "1,3,5,7,9".
    
       Months or days of the week can be specified by name.
    
       Environment variables can be set in the crontab.  In BSD or AT&T,  the
       environment  handed  to  child  processes  is  basically  the one from
       /etc/rc.
    
       Command output is mailed to the crontab owner (BSD can't do this), can
       be  mailed  to  a  person  other than the crontab owner (SysV can't do
       this), or the feature can be turned off and no mail will  be  sent  at
       all (SysV can't do this either).
    
       All  of  the  `@'  commands that can appear in place of the first five
       fields are extensions.

LIMITATIONS
       The cron daemon runs with a defined timezone.  It currently  does  not
       support  per-user  timezones.  All the tasks: system's and user's will
       be run based on the configured timezone.  Even if a user specifies the
       TZ  environment variable in his crontab this will affect only the com‐
       mands executed in the crontab, not the execution of the crontab  tasks
       themselves.

       POSIX  specifies that the day of month and the day of week fields both
       need to match the current time if either of them  is  a  *.   However,
       this  implementation  only checks if the first character is a *.  This
       is why "0 0 */2 * sun" runs every Sunday that's an uneven  date  while
       the  POSIX standard would have it run every Sunday and on every uneven
       date.
    
       The crontab syntax does not make it possible to  define  all  possible
       periods  one  can  imagine.  For example, it is not straightforward to
       define the last weekday of a month.  To have a task run in a time  pe‐
       riod  that  cannot  be defined using crontab syntax, the best approach
       would be to have the program itself check the date and  time  informa‐
       tion  and  continue  execution  only if the period matches the desired
       one.
    
       If the program itself cannot do the checks then a wrapper script would
       be  required.   Useful  tools that could be used for date analysis are
       ncal or calendar For example, to run a program the  last  Saturday  of
       every month you could use the following wrapper code:
    
       0 4 * * Sat   [ "$(date +\%e)" = "$(LANG=C ncal | sed -n 's/^Sa .* \([0–9]\+\) *$/\x1/p')" ] && echo "Last Saturday" && program_to_run

DIAGNOSTICS
       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character.
       If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline  (i.e.  terminated
       by  EOF),  cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken.
       A warning will be written to syslog.
