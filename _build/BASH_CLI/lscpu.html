<p>NAME
       lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS
       lscpu [options]</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION
       lscpu  gathers  CPU architecture information from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo
       and any applicable architecture-specific libraries  (e.g.  librtas  on
       Powerpc).  The command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy
       readability by humans.  The information  includes,  for  example,  the
       number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access
       (NUMA) nodes.  There is also information  about  the  CPU  caches  and
       cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.</p>

<pre><code>   In  virtualized  environments,  the  CPU architecture information dis‐
   played reflects the configuration of the guest operating system  which
   is  typically different from the physical (host) system.  On architec‐
   tures that support retrieving  physical  topology  information,  lscpu
   also displays the number of physical sockets, chips, cores in the host
   system.

   Options that result in an output table have a list argument.  Use this
   argument  to  customize the command output.  Specify a comma-separated
   list of column labels to limit the output table to only the  specified
   columns,  arranged  in the specified order.  See COLUMNS for a list of
   valid column labels.  The column labels are not case sensitive.

   Not all columns are supported on all architectures.  If an unsupported
   column  is specified, lscpu prints the column but does not provide any
   data for it.

   The default output formatting on terminal maybe optimized  for  better
   readability.   The  output for non-terminals (e.g. pipes) is never af‐
   fected by this optimization and it is always in "Field:  data\n"  for‐
   mat.

<p>COLUMNS
       Note  that  topology  elements  (core,  socket, etc.) use a sequential
       unique ID starting from zero, but CPU logical numbers follow the  ker‐
       nel where there is no guarantee of sequential numbering.</p>

<pre><code>   CPU    The logical CPU number of a CPU as used by the Linux kernel.

   CORE   The logical core number.  A core can contain several CPUs.

   SOCKET The logical socket number.  A socket can contain several cores.

   BOOK   The logical book number.  A book can contain several sockets.

   DRAWER The logical drawer number.  A drawer can contain several books.

   NODE   The logical NUMA node number.  A node can contain several draw‐
          ers.

   CACHE  Information about how caches are shared between CPUs.

   ADDRESS
          The physical address of a CPU.

   ONLINE Indicator that shows whether the Linux instance currently makes
          use of the CPU.

   CONFIGURED
          Indicator that shows if the hypervisor has allocated the CPU to
          the virtual hardware on which the Linux  instance  runs.   CPUs
          that  are  configured  can be set online by the Linux instance.
          This column contains data only if your hardware system and  hy‐
          pervisor support dynamic CPU resource allocation.

   POLARIZATION
          This  column contains data for Linux instances that run on vir‐
          tual hardware with a hypervisor that can switch  the  CPU  dis‐
          patching mode (polarization).  The polarization can be:

          horizontal  The workload is spread across all available CPUs.

          vertical    The workload is concentrated on few CPUs.

          For  vertical polarization, the column also shows the degree of
          concentration, high, medium, or low.  This column contains data
          only  if your hardware system and hypervisor support CPU polar‐
          ization.

   MAXMHZ Maximum megahertz value for the CPU. Useful when lscpu is  used
          as  hardware inventory information gathering tool.  Notice that
          the megahertz value is dynamic, and driven by CPU governor  de‐
          pending on current resource need.

   MINMHZ Minimum megahertz value for the CPU.

<p>OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Include  lines  for  online and offline CPUs in the output (de‐
              fault for -e).  This option may only be specified together with
              option -e or -p.</p>

<pre><code>   -B, --bytes
          Print  the  sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable for‐
          mat.

   -b, --online
          Limit the output to online CPUs (default for -p).  This  option
          may only be specified together with option -e or -p.

   -C, --caches[=list]
          Display  details about CPU caches.  For details about available
          information see --help output.

          If the list argument is omitted, all columns for which data  is
          available are included in the command output.

          When  specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal
          sign (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other  white‐
          space.   Examples:  '-C=NAME,ONE-SIZE'  or  '--caches=NAME,ONE-
          SIZE'.

   -c, --offline
          Limit the output to offline CPUs.   This  option  may  only  be
          specified together with option -e or -p.

   -e, --extended[=list]
          Display the CPU information in human-readable format.

          If  the list argument is omitted, all columns for which data is
          available are included in the command output.

          When specifying the list argument, the string of option,  equal
          sign  (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other white‐
          space.  Examples: '-e=cpu,node' or '--extended=cpu,node'.

   -h, --help
          Display help text and exit.

   -J, --json
          Use JSON output format for the default summary or extended out‐
          put (see --extended).

   -p, --parse[=list]
          Optimize the command output for easy parsing.

          If the list argument is omitted, the command output is compati‐
          ble with earlier versions of lscpu.  In this compatible format,
          two  commas  are used to separate CPU cache columns.  If no CPU
          caches are identified the cache column is omitted.
          If the list argument is used, cache columns are separated  with
          a colon (:).

          When  specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal
          sign (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other  white‐
          space.  Examples: '-p=cpu,node' or '--parse=cpu,node'.

   -s, --sysroot directory
          Gather  CPU  data  for a Linux instance other than the instance
          from which the lscpu command is issued.  The  specified  direc‐
          tory is the system root of the Linux instance to be inspected.

   -x, --hex
          Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (for example "ff").  The de‐
          fault is to print the sets in list format  (for  example  0,1).
          Note that before version 2.30 the mask has been printed with 0x
          prefix.

   -y, --physical
          Display physical IDs for all  columns  with  topology  elements
          (core,  socket,  etc.).   Other than logical IDs, which are as‐
          signed by lscpu, physical IDs are platform-specific values that
          are  provided  by  the kernel. Physical IDs are not necessarily
          unique and they might not be  arranged  sequentially.   If  the
          kernel  could  not  retrieve a physical ID for an element lscpu
          prints the dash (-) character.

          The CPU logical numbers are not affected by this option.

   -V, --version
          Display version information and exit.

   --output-all
          Output all available columns.  This  option  must  be  combined
          with either --extended, --parse or --caches.

<p>BUGS
       The  basic  overview of CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the
       first CPU only.</p>

<pre><code>   Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.

   On virtual hardware the number of cores per socket, etc. can be wrong.
