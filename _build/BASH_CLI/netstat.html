<p>NOTES
       This program is mostly obsolete.  Replacement for netstat is ss.   Re‐
       placement  for  netstat -r is ip route.  Replacement for netstat -i is
       ip -s link.  Replacement for netstat -g is ip maddr.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION
       Netstat prints information about the Linux networking subsystem.   The
       type  of  information  printed is controlled by the first argument, as
       follows:</p>
<p>(none)
       By default, netstat displays a list of open  sockets.   If  you  don't
       specify  any  address families, then the active sockets of all config‐
       ured address families will be printed.</p>
<p>--route, -r
       Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in route(8) for
       details.  netstat -r and route -e produce the same output.</p>
<p>--groups, -g
       Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>--interfaces, -i
       Display a table of all network interfaces.</p>
<p>--masquerade, -M
       Display a list of masqueraded connections.</p>
<p>--statistics, -s
       Display summary statistics for each protocol.</p>
<p>OPTIONS
   --verbose, -v
       Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some
       useful information about unconfigured address families.</p>
<p>--wide, -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as  needed.  This
       is optional for now to not break existing scripts.</p>
<p>--numeric, -n
       Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host,
       port or user names.</p>
<p>--numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the  resolution  of
       port or user names.</p>
<p>--numeric-ports
       shows  numerical  port  numbers  but does not affect the resolution of
       host or user names.</p>
<p>--numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or
       port names.</p>
<p>--protocol=family, -A
       Specifies  the address families (perhaps better described as low level
       protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family is  a  comma
       (',')  separated  list  of  address  family keywords like inet, inet6,
       unix, ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and  bluetooth.   This  has  the
       same  effect  as  using  the  --inet|-4, --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx,
       --ax25, --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.</p>

<pre><code>   The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp  pro‐
   tocol sockets.

   The  address family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol
   sockets.

</code></pre>
<p>-c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second
       continuously.</p>
<p>-e, --extend
       Display additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum de‐
       tail.</p>
<p>-o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.</p>
<p>-p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.</p>
<p>-l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)</p>
<p>-a, --all
       Show both listening and non-listening sockets.  With the  --interfaces
       option, show interfaces that are not up</p>
<p>-F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)</p>
<p>-C
       Print routing information from the route cache.</p>
<p>OUTPUT
   Active Internet connections (TCP, UDP, UDPLite, raw)
   Proto
       The protocol (tcp, udp, udpl, raw) used by the socket.</p>
<p>Recv-Q
       Established:  The  count  of bytes not copied by the user program con‐
       nected to this socket.  Listening: Since  Kernel  2.6.18  this  column
       contains the current syn backlog.</p>
<p>Send-Q
       Established:  The  count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host.
       Listening: Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the  maximum  size
       of the syn backlog.</p>
<p>Local Address
       Address  and  port  number of the local end of the socket.  Unless the
       --numeric (-n) option is specified, the socket address is resolved  to
       its canonical host name (FQDN), and the port number is translated into
       the corresponding service name.</p>
<p>Foreign Address
       Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.  Analogous to
       "Local Address".</p>
<p>State
       The  state  of  the  socket. Since there are no states in raw mode and
       usually no states used in UDP and UDPLite, this  column  may  be  left
       blank. Normally this can be one of several values:</p>

<pre><code>   ESTABLISHED
          The socket has an established connection.

   SYN_SENT
          The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.

   SYN_RECV
          A connection request has been received from the network.

   FIN_WAIT1
          The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.

   FIN_WAIT2
          Connection  is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown
          from the remote end.

   TIME_WAIT
          The socket is waiting after close to handle  packets  still  in
          the network.

   CLOSE  The socket is not being used.

   CLOSE_WAIT
          The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.

   LAST_ACK
          The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed. Waiting
          for acknowledgement.

   LISTEN The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Such sockets
          are not included in the output unless you specify the --listen‐
          ing (-l) or --all (-a) option.

   CLOSING
          Both sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data
          sent.

   UNKNOWN
          The state of the socket is unknown.

</code></pre>
<p>User
       The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of the socket.</p>
<p>PID/Program name
       Slash-separated  pair  of the process id (PID) and process name of the
       process that owns the socket.  --program causes this column to be  in‐
       cluded.   You will also need superuser privileges to see this informa‐
       tion on sockets you don't own.  This identification information is not
       yet available for IPX sockets.</p>
<p>Timer
       (this needs to be written)</p>
<p>Active UNIX domain Sockets
   Proto
       The protocol (usually unix) used by the socket.</p>
<p>RefCnt
       The reference count (i.e. attached processes via this socket).</p>
<p>Flags
       The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W)
       or SO_NOSPACE (N).  SO_ACCECPTON is used  on  unconnected  sockets  if
       their  corresponding  processes are waiting for a connect request. The
       other flags are not of normal interest.</p>
<p>Type
       There are several types of socket access:</p>

<pre><code>   SOCK_DGRAM
          The socket is used in Datagram (connectionless) mode.

   SOCK_STREAM
          This is a stream (connection) socket.

   SOCK_RAW
          The socket is used as a raw socket.

   SOCK_RDM
          This one serves reliably-delivered messages.

   SOCK_SEQPACKET
          This is a sequential packet socket.

   SOCK_PACKET
          Raw interface access socket.

   UNKNOWN
          Who ever knows what the future will bring us  -  just  fill  in
          here :-)

</code></pre>
<p>State
       This field will contain one of the following Keywords:</p>

<pre><code>   FREE   The socket is not allocated

   LISTENING
          The socket is listening for a connection request.  Such sockets
          are only included in the output if you specify the  --listening
          (-l) or --all (-a) option.

   CONNECTING
          The socket is about to establish a connection.

   CONNECTED
          The socket is connected.

   DISCONNECTING
          The socket is disconnecting.

   (empty)
          The socket is not connected to another one.

   UNKNOWN
          This state should never happen.

</code></pre>
<p>PID/Program name
       Process  ID  (PID) and process name of the process that has the socket
       open.  More info available  in  Active  Internet  connections  section
       written above.</p>
<p>Path
       This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached to
       the socket.</p>
<p>Active IPX sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)</p>
<p>Active NET/ROM sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)</p>
<p>Active AX.25 sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)</p>
<p>FILES
       /etc/services -- The services translation file</p>

<pre><code>   /proc -- Mount point for the proc filesystem, which  gives  access  to
   kernel status information via the following files.

<p>BUGS
       Occasionally  strange information may appear if a socket changes as it
       is viewed. This is unlikely to occur.</p>
