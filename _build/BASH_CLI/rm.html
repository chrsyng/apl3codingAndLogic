directories.  Synopsis:</p>

<pre><code> rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

</code></pre>
<p>If the ‘-I’ or ‘--interactive=once’ option is given, and there are
more than three files or the ‘-r’, ‘-R’, or ‘--recursive’ are given,
then ‘rm’ prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is
aborted.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and
the ‘-f’ or ‘--force’ option is not given, or the ‘-i’ or
‘--interactive=always’ option <em>is</em> given, ‘rm’ prompts the user for
whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the
file is skipped.</p>
<p>Any attempt to remove a file whose last file name component is ‘.’ or
‘..’ is rejected without any prompting, as mandated by POSIX.</p>
<p><em>Warning</em>: If you use ‘rm’ to remove a file, it is usually possible
to recover the contents of that file.  If you want more assurance that
the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using ‘shred’.</p>
<p>The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common
options::.</p>
<p>‘-d’
‘--dir’
     Remove the listed directories if they are empty.</p>
<p>‘-f’
‘--force’
     Ignore nonexistent files and missing operands, and never prompt the
     user.  Ignore any previous ‘--interactive’ (‘-i’) option.</p>
<p>‘-i’
     Prompt whether to remove each file.  If the response is not
     affirmative, the file is skipped.  Ignore any previous ‘--force’
     (‘-f’) option.  Equivalent to ‘--interactive=always’.</p>
<p>‘-I’
     Prompt once whether to proceed with the command, if more than three
     files are named or if a recursive removal is requested.  Ignore any
     previous ‘--force’ (‘-f’) option.  Equivalent to
     ‘--interactive=once’.</p>
<p>‘--interactive [=WHEN]’
     Specify when to issue an interactive prompt.  WHEN may be omitted,
     or one of:
        • never - Do not prompt at all.
        • once - Prompt once if more than three files are named or if a
          recursive removal is requested.  Equivalent to ‘-I’.
        • always - Prompt for every file being removed.  Equivalent to
          ‘-i’.
     ‘--interactive’ with no WHEN is equivalent to
     ‘--interactive=always’.</p>
<p>‘--one-file-system’
     When removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is
     on a file system different from that of the corresponding command
     line argument.  This option is useful when removing a build
     “chroot” hierarchy, which normally contains no valuable data.
     However, it is not uncommon to bind-mount ‘/home’ into such a
     hierarchy, to make it easier to use one’s start-up file.  The catch
     is that it’s easy to forget to unmount ‘/home’.  Then, when you use
     ‘rm -rf’ to remove your normally throw-away chroot, that command
     will remove everything under ‘/home’, too.  Use the
     ‘--one-file-system’ option, and it will warn about and skip
     directories on other file systems.  Of course, this will not save
     your ‘/home’ if it and your chroot happen to be on the same file
     system.  See also ‘--preserve-root=all’ to protect command line
     arguments themselves.</p>
<p>‘--preserve-root [=all]’
     Fail upon any attempt to remove the root directory, ‘/’, when used
     with the ‘--recursive’ option.  This is the default behavior.
     *Note Treating / specially::.  When ‘all’ is specified, reject any
     command line argument that is not on the same file system as its
     parent.</p>
<p>‘--no-preserve-root’
     Do not treat ‘/’ specially when removing recursively.  This option
     is not recommended unless you really want to remove all the files
     on your computer.  *Note Treating / specially::.</p>
<p>‘-r’
‘-R’
‘--recursive’
     Remove the listed directories and their contents recursively.</p>
<p>‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Print the name of each file before removing it.</p>
<p>One common question is how to remove files whose names begin with a
‘-’.  GNU ‘rm’, like every program that uses the ‘getopt’ function to
parse its arguments, lets you use the ‘--’ option to indicate that all
following arguments are non-options.  To remove a file called ‘-f’ in
the current directory, you could type either:</p>

<pre><code> rm -- -f

</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>

<pre><code> rm ./-f

</code></pre>
<p>The Unix ‘rm’ program’s use of a single ‘-’ for this purpose predates
the development of the ‘getopt’ standard syntax.</p>
<p>An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value
indicates failure.</p>
