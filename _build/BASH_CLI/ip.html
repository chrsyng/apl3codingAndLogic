</code></pre>
<p>OPTIONS
       -V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.</p>

<pre><code>   -h, -human, -human-readable
          output statistics with human readable values followed by suf‐
          fix.

   -b, -batch &lt;FILENAME&gt;
          Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke
          them.  First failure will cause termination of ip.

   -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any
          errors during execution of the commands, the application return
          code will be non zero.

   -s, -stats, -statistics
          Output more information. If the option appears twice or more,
          the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the informa‐
          tion is statistics or some time values.

   -d, -details
          Output more detailed information.

   -l, -loops &lt;COUNT&gt;
          Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic
          will attempt before giving up. The default is 10.  Zero (0)
          means loop until all addresses are removed.

   -f, -family &lt;FAMILY&gt;
          Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family iden‐
          tifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If
          this option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from
          other arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give
          enough information to guess the family, ip falls back to the
          default one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family
          identifier meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

   -4     shortcut for -family inet.

   -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

   -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

   -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

   -0     shortcut for -family link.

   -o, -oneline
          output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with
          the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count
          records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

   -r, -resolve
          use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
          host addresses.

   -n, -netns &lt;NETNS&gt;
          switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
          it just simplifies executing of:

          ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

          to

          ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

   -a, -all
          executes specified command over all objects, it depends if com‐
          mand supports this option.

   -c[color][={always|auto|never}
          Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always,
          color output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parame‐
          ter is auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling
          color output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled.
          If specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence.
          This flag is ignored if -json is also given.

          Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment
          variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

   -t, -timestamp
          display current time when using monitor option.

   -ts, -tshort
          Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

   -rc, -rcvbuf&lt;SIZE&gt;
          Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

   -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

   -br, -brief
          Print only basic information in a tabular format for better
          readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr
          show and ip link show commands.

   -j, -json
          Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

   -p, -pretty
          The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse
          but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds indentation
          for readability.

</code></pre>
<p>COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible
       actions depends on the object type.  As a rule, it is possible to add,
       delete and show (or list ) objects, but some objects do not allow all
       of these operations or have some additional commands. The help command
       is available for all objects. It prints out a list of available com‐
       mands and argument syntax conventions.</p>

<pre><code>   If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually it
   is list or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed, help.

</code></pre>
<p>ENVIRONMENT
       COLORFGBG
              If set, it's value is used for detection whether background is
              dark or light and use contrast colors for it.</p>

<pre><code>          COLORFGBG environment variable usually contains either two or
          three values separated by semicolons; we want the last value in
          either case.  If this value is 0-6 or 8, chose colors suitable
          for dark background:

          COLORFGBG=";0" ip -c a

</code></pre>
<p>EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful, and 1 if there is a syntax
       error.  If an error was reported by the kernel exit status is 2.</p>
<p>EXAMPLES
       ip addr
           Shows addresses assigned to all network interfaces.</p>

<pre><code>   ip neigh
       Shows the current neighbour table in kernel.

   ip link set x up
       Bring up interface x.

   ip link set x down
       Bring down interface x.

   ip route
       Show table routes.

<p>NAME
       ip - Linux IPv4 protocol implementation</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>

<pre><code>   #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
   #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
   #include &lt;netinet/ip.h&gt; /* superset of previous */

   tcp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   udp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
   raw_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, protocol);

</code></pre>
<p>DESCRIPTION
       Linux  implements  the  Internet  Protocol,  version  4,  described in
       RFC 791 and RFC 1122.  ip contains a level 2 multicasting  implementa‐
       tion  conforming to RFC 1112.  It also contains an IP router including
       a packet filter.</p>

<pre><code>   The programming interface is BSD-sockets compatible.  For more  infor‐
   mation on sockets, see socket(7).

   An IP socket is created using socket(2):

       socket(AF_INET, socket_type, protocol);

   Valid socket types are SOCK_STREAM to open a tcp(7) socket, SOCK_DGRAM
   to open a udp(7) socket, or SOCK_RAW to open a raw(7) socket to access
   the  IP  protocol  directly.   protocol  is  the IP protocol in the IP
   header to be received or sent.  The only valid values for protocol are
   0 and IPPROTO_TCP for TCP sockets, and 0 and IPPROTO_UDP for UDP sock‐
   ets.  For SOCK_RAW you may specify a valid IANA IP protocol defined in
   RFC 1700 assigned numbers.

   When  a  process wants to receive new incoming packets or connections,
   it should bind a socket to a local interface  address  using  bind(2).
   In  this case, only one IP socket may be bound to any given local (ad‐
   dress, port) pair.  When INADDR_ANY is specified in the bind call, the
   socket  will  be  bound  to  all  local interfaces.  When listen(2) is
   called on an unbound socket, the socket is automatically  bound  to  a
   random  free port with the local address set to INADDR_ANY.  When con‐
   nect(2) is called on an unbound socket, the  socket  is  automatically
   bound  to a random free port or to a usable shared port with the local
   address set to INADDR_ANY.

   A TCP local socket address that has been bound is unavailable for some
   time  after  closing, unless the SO_REUSEADDR flag has been set.  Care
   should be taken when using this flag as it makes TCP less reliable.

</code></pre>
<p>Address format
       An IP socket address is defined as a combination of  an  IP  interface
       address and a 16-bit port number.  The basic IP protocol does not sup‐
       ply port numbers, they are implemented by higher level protocols  like
       udp(7) and tcp(7).  On raw sockets sin_port is set to the IP protocol.</p>

<pre><code>       struct sockaddr_in {
           sa_family_t    sin_family; /* address family: AF_INET */
           in_port_t      sin_port;   /* port in network byte order */
           struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* internet address */
       };

       /* Internet address. */
       struct in_addr {
           uint32_t       s_addr;     /* address in network byte order */
       };

   sin_family  is  always set to AF_INET.  This is required; in Linux 2.2
   most networking functions return EINVAL when this setting is  missing.
   sin_port  contains  the  port in network byte order.  The port numbers
   below 1024 are called privileged ports (or sometimes: reserved ports).
   Only   a  privileged  process  (on  Linux:  a  process  that  has  the
   CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability in the user  namespace  governing  its
   network  namespace)  may  bind(2) to these sockets.  Note that the raw
   IPv4 protocol as such has no concept of a port, they  are  implemented
   only by higher protocols like tcp(7) and udp(7).

   sin_addr  is the IP host address.  The s_addr member of struct in_addr
   contains the host interface address in network  byte  order.   in_addr
   should  be assigned one of the INADDR_* values (e.g., INADDR_LOOPBACK)
   using  htonl(3)  or  set   using   the   inet_aton(3),   inet_addr(3),
   inet_makeaddr(3)  library functions or directly with the name resolver
   (see gethostbyname(3)).

   IPv4 addresses are divided into unicast, broadcast, and multicast  ad‐
   dresses.   Unicast  addresses  specify  a  single interface of a host,
   broadcast addresses specify all hosts on a network, and multicast  ad‐
   dresses  address  all hosts in a multicast group.  Datagrams to broad‐
   cast addresses can be sent or  received  only  when  the  SO_BROADCAST
   socket  flag  is  set.  In the current implementation, connection-ori‐
   ented sockets are allowed to use only unicast addresses.

   Note that the address and the port are always stored in  network  byte
   order.   In  particular,  this means that you need to call htons(3) on
   the number that is assigned to a port.  All address/port  manipulation
   functions in the standard library work in network byte order.

   There  are  several special addresses: INADDR_LOOPBACK (127.0.0.1) al‐
   ways refers to the local host  via  the  loopback  device;  INADDR_ANY
   (0.0.0.0)    means   any   address   for   binding;   INADDR_BROADCAST
   (255.255.255.255) means any host and has the same effect  on  bind  as
   INADDR_ANY for historical reasons.

</code></pre>
<p>Socket options
       IP supports some protocol-specific socket options that can be set with
       setsockopt(2) and read with getsockopt(2).  The  socket  option  level
       for  IP  is  IPPROTO_IP.   A  boolean  integer flag is zero when it is
       false, otherwise true.</p>

<pre><code>   When an invalid socket option is specified, getsockopt(2) and setsock‐
   opt(2) fail with the error ENOPROTOOPT.

   IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 1.2)
          Join a multicast group.  Argument is an ip_mreqn structure.

       struct ip_mreqn {
           struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* IP multicast group
                                            address */
           struct in_addr imr_address;   /* IP address of local
                                            interface */
           int            imr_ifindex;   /* interface index */
       };

   imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast group the applica‐
   tion wants to join or leave.  It must be a valid multicast address (or
   setsockopt(2)  fails  with  the error EINVAL).  imr_address is the ad‐
   dress of the local interface with which the  system  should  join  the
   multicast  group;  if it is equal to INADDR_ANY, an appropriate inter‐
   face is chosen by the system.  imr_ifindex is the interface  index  of
   the  interface that should join/leave the imr_multiaddr group, or 0 to
   indicate any interface.

          The ip_mreqn structure is available only since Linux 2.2.   For
          compatibility,  the  old ip_mreq structure (present since Linux
          1.2) is still supported; it differs from ip_mreqn only  by  not
          including  the imr_ifindex field.  (The kernel determines which
          structure is being passed based on the size passed in optlen.)

          IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP is valid only for setsockopt(2).

   IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
          Join a multicast group and allow receiving  data  only  from  a
          specified source.  Argument is an ip_mreq_source structure.

       struct ip_mreq_source {
           struct in_addr imr_multiaddr;  /* IP multicast group
                                             address */
           struct in_addr imr_interface;  /* IP address of local
                                             interface */
           struct in_addr imr_sourceaddr; /* IP address of
                                             multicast source */
       };

   The  ip_mreq_source  structure  is similar to ip_mreqn described under
   IP_ADD_MEMBERSIP.  The imr_multiaddr field contains the address of the
   multicast  group  the application wants to join or leave.  The imr_in‐
   terface field is the address of the local  interface  with  which  the
   system  should  join the multicast group.  Finally, the imr_sourceaddr
   field contains the address of the source the application wants to  re‐
   ceive data from.

          This  option can be used multiple times to allow receiving data
          from more than one source.

   IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT (since Linux 4.2)
          Inform the kernel to not reserve an ephemeral port  when  using
          bind(2)  with a port number of 0.  The port will later be auto‐
          matically chosen at connect(2) time, in a way that allows shar‐
          ing a source port as long as the 4-tuple is unique.

   IP_BLOCK_SOURCE (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
          Stop receiving multicast data from a specific source in a given
          group.  This is valid only after the application has subscribed
          to  the  multicast  group  using  either  IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP  or
          IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.

          Argument is an  ip_mreq_source  structure  as  described  under
          IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.

   IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 1.2)
          Leave  a  multicast  group.  Argument is an ip_mreqn or ip_mreq
          structure similar to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP.

   IP_DROP_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
          Leave a source-specific group—that is, stop receiving data from
          a  given multicast group that come from a given source.  If the
          application has subscribed to multiple sources within the  same
          group, data from the remaining sources will still be delivered.
          To  stop  receiving  data  from  all  sources  at   once,   use
          IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP.

          Argument  is  an  ip_mreq_source  structure  as described under
          IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.

   IP_FREEBIND (since Linux 2.4)
          If enabled, this boolean option allows binding to an IP address
          that is nonlocal or does not (yet) exist.  This permits listen‐
          ing on a socket, without requiring the underlying  network  in‐
          terface  or  the  specified  dynamic IP address to be up at the
          time that the application is trying to bind to it.  This option
          is  the per-socket equivalent of the ip_nonlocal_bind /proc in‐
          terface described below.

   IP_HDRINCL (since Linux 2.0)
          If enabled, the user supplies an IP header in front of the user
          data.  Valid only for SOCK_RAW sockets; see raw(7) for more in‐
          formation.  When this flag is enabled, the values set by IP_OP‐
          TIONS, IP_TTL, and IP_TOS are ignored.

   IP_MSFILTER (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
          This  option provides access to the advanced full-state filter‐
          ing API.  Argument is an ip_msfilter structure.

       struct ip_msfilter {
           struct in_addr imsf_multiaddr; /* IP multicast group
                                             address */
           struct in_addr imsf_interface; /* IP address of local
                                             interface */
           uint32_t       imsf_fmode;     /* Filter-mode */

           uint32_t       imsf_numsrc;    /* Number of sources in
                                             the following array */
           struct in_addr imsf_slist[1];  /* Array of source
                                             addresses */
       };

   There are two macros, MCAST_INCLUDE and MCAST_EXCLUDE,  which  can  be
   used  to  specify  the  filtering  mode.   Additionally, the IP_MSFIL‐
   TER_SIZE(n) macro exists to determine how much  memory  is  needed  to
   store ip_msfilter structure with n sources in the source list.

          For the full description of multicast source filtering refer to
          RFC 3376.

   IP_MTU (since Linux 2.2)
          Retrieve the current known path MTU of the current socket.  Re‐
          turns an integer.

          IP_MTU is valid only for getsockopt(2) and can be employed only
          when the socket has been connected.

   IP_MTU_DISCOVER (since Linux 2.2)
          Set or receive the Path MTU Discovery  setting  for  a  socket.
          When  enabled, Linux will perform Path MTU Discovery as defined
          in RFC 1191 on SOCK_STREAM sockets.  For non-SOCK_STREAM  sock‐
          ets, IP_PMTUDISC_DO forces the don't-fragment flag to be set on
          all outgoing packets.  It is the user's responsibility to pack‐
          etize the data in MTU-sized chunks and to do the retransmits if
          necessary.  The kernel will reject  (with  EMSGSIZE)  datagrams
          that are bigger than the known path MTU.  IP_PMTUDISC_WANT will
          fragment a datagram if needed according to  the  path  MTU,  or
          will set the don't-fragment flag otherwise.

          The system-wide default can be toggled between IP_PMTUDISC_WANT
          and IP_PMTUDISC_DONT by writing (respectively, zero and nonzero
          values) to the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc file.

          Path MTU discovery value   Meaning
          IP_PMTUDISC_WANT           Use per-route settings.
          IP_PMTUDISC_DONT           Never do Path MTU Discovery.
          IP_PMTUDISC_DO             Always do Path MTU Discovery.
          IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE          Set DF but ignore Path MTU.

          When  PMTU discovery is enabled, the kernel automatically keeps
          track of the path MTU per destination host.  When  it  is  con‐
          nected  to a specific peer with connect(2), the currently known
          path MTU can be retrieved conveniently using the IP_MTU  socket
          option  (e.g., after an EMSGSIZE error occurred).  The path MTU
          may change over time.  For  connectionless  sockets  with  many
          destinations,  the  new MTU for a given destination can also be
          accessed using the error queue (see IP_RECVERR).  A  new  error
          will be queued for every incoming MTU update.

          While  MTU discovery is in progress, initial packets from data‐
          gram sockets may be dropped.  Applications using UDP should  be
          aware of this and not take it into account for their packet re‐
          transmit strategy.

          To bootstrap the path  MTU  discovery  process  on  unconnected
          sockets,  it  is  possible  to  start  with a big datagram size
          (headers up to 64 kilobytes long) and let it shrink by  updates
          of the path MTU.

          To  get an initial estimate of the path MTU, connect a datagram
          socket to the destination address using connect(2) and retrieve
          the MTU by calling getsockopt(2) with the IP_MTU option.

          It   is  possible  to  implement  RFC  4821  MTU  probing  with
          SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_RAW sockets by setting a value of  IP_PMTUD‐
          ISC_PROBE (available since Linux 2.6.22).  This is also partic‐
          ularly useful for diagnostic tools such  as  tracepath(8)  that
          wish  to  deliberately  send  probe packets larger than the ob‐
          served Path MTU.

   IP_MULTICAST_ALL (since Linux 2.6.31)
          This option can be used to modify the delivery policy of multi‐
          cast  messages  to sockets bound to the wildcard INADDR_ANY ad‐
          dress.  The argument is a boolean integer (defaults to 1).   If
          set  to 1, the socket will receive messages from all the groups
          that have been joined globally on the whole system.  Otherwise,
          it  will  deliver  messages only from the groups that have been
          explicitly joined (for example via  the  IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP  op‐
          tion) on this particular socket.

   IP_MULTICAST_IF (since Linux 1.2)
          Set  the local device for a multicast socket.  The argument for
          setsockopt(2) is an  ip_mreqn  or  (since  Linux  3.5)  ip_mreq
          structure  similar  to  IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, or an in_addr struc‐
          ture.  (The kernel determines which structure is  being  passed
          based  on  the  size passed in optlen.)  For getsockopt(2), the
          argument is an in_addr structure.

   IP_MULTICAST_LOOP (since Linux 1.2)
          Set or read a boolean integer argument that determines  whether
          sent multicast packets should be looped back to the local sock‐
          ets.

   IP_MULTICAST_TTL (since Linux 1.2)
          Set or read the time-to-live value of outgoing multicast  pack‐
          ets  for this socket.  It is very important for multicast pack‐
          ets to set the smallest TTL possible.  The default is  1  which
          means  that multicast packets don't leave the local network un‐
          less the user program explicitly requests it.  Argument  is  an
          integer.

   IP_NODEFRAG (since Linux 2.6.36)
          If  enabled  (argument  is nonzero), the reassembly of outgoing
          packets is disabled in the netfilter layer.  The argument is an
          integer.

          This option is valid only for SOCK_RAW sockets.

   IP_OPTIONS (since Linux 2.0)
          Set  or  get  the  IP options to be sent with every packet from
          this socket.  The arguments are a pointer to  a  memory  buffer
          containing  the  options  and  the option length.  The setsock‐
          opt(2) call sets the IP options associated with a socket.   The
          maximum  option size for IPv4 is 40 bytes.  See RFC 791 for the
          allowed options.  When the initial  connection  request  packet
          for  a  SOCK_STREAM  socket contains IP options, the IP options
          will be set automatically  to  the  options  from  the  initial
          packet with routing headers reversed.  Incoming packets are not
          allowed to change options after the connection is  established.
          The  processing  of all incoming source routing options is dis‐
          abled  by  default  and  can  be  enabled  by  using  the   ac‐
          cept_source_route  /proc  interface.   Other options like time‐
          stamps are still handled.  For datagram sockets, IP options can
          be  only  set  by  the  local user.  Calling getsockopt(2) with
          IP_OPTIONS puts the current IP options used  for  sending  into
          the supplied buffer.

   IP_PKTINFO (since Linux 2.2)
          Pass  an  IP_PKTINFO  ancillary message that contains a pktinfo
          structure that supplies some  information  about  the  incoming
          packet.   This  only  works for datagram oriented sockets.  The
          argument is a flag that tells the socket whether the IP_PKTINFO
          message  should  be passed or not.  The message itself can only
          be sent/retrieved  as  control  message  with  a  packet  using
          recvmsg(2) or sendmsg(2).

              struct in_pktinfo {
                  unsigned int   ipi_ifindex;  /* Interface index */
                  struct in_addr ipi_spec_dst; /* Local address */
                  struct in_addr ipi_addr;     /* Header Destination
                                                  address */
              };

          ipi_ifindex is the unique index of the interface the packet was
          received on.  ipi_spec_dst is the local address of  the  packet
          and  ipi_addr  is the destination address in the packet header.
          If IP_PKTINFO is passed to sendmsg(2) and ipi_spec_dst  is  not
          zero, then it is used as the local source address for the rout‐
          ing table lookup and for setting up IP  source  route  options.
          When  ipi_ifindex is not zero, the primary local address of the
          interface specified by the index  overwrites  ipi_spec_dst  for
          the routing table lookup.

   IP_RECVERR (since Linux 2.2)
          Enable  extended  reliable error message passing.  When enabled
          on a datagram socket, all generated errors will be queued in  a
          per-socket error queue.  When the user receives an error from a
          socket  operation,  the  errors  can  be  received  by  calling
          recvmsg(2)  with  the  MSG_ERRQUEUE  flag  set.   The  sock_ex‐
          tended_err structure describing the error will be passed in  an
          ancillary  message  with  the type IP_RECVERR and the level IP‐
          PROTO_IP.  This is useful for reliable error handling on uncon‐
          nected  sockets.   The received data portion of the error queue
          contains the error packet.

          The IP_RECVERR control  message  contains  a  sock_extended_err
          structure:

              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE    0
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL   1
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP    2
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6   3

              struct sock_extended_err {
                  uint32_t ee_errno;   /* error number */
                  uint8_t  ee_origin;  /* where the error originated */
                  uint8_t  ee_type;    /* type */
                  uint8_t  ee_code;    /* code */
                  uint8_t  ee_pad;
                  uint32_t ee_info;    /* additional information */
                  uint32_t ee_data;    /* other data */
                  /* More data may follow */
              };

              struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);

          ee_errno  contains  the  errno  number  of  the  queued  error.
          ee_origin is the origin code of  where  the  error  originated.
          The  other  fields  are protocol-specific.  The macro SO_EE_OF‐
          FENDER returns a pointer to the address of the  network  object
          where  the  error originated from given a pointer to the ancil‐
          lary message.  If this address is not known, the sa_family mem‐
          ber  of the sockaddr contains AF_UNSPEC and the other fields of
          the sockaddr are undefined.

          IP uses the sock_extended_err structure as  follows:  ee_origin
          is  set  to  SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP  for  errors received as an ICMP
          packet, or SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL  for  locally  generated  errors.
          Unknown  values should be ignored.  ee_type and ee_code are set
          from the type and code fields of the ICMP header.  ee_info con‐
          tains the discovered MTU for EMSGSIZE errors.  The message also
          contains the sockaddr_in of the node caused  the  error,  which
          can  be accessed with the SO_EE_OFFENDER macro.  The sin_family
          field of the  SO_EE_OFFENDER  address  is  AF_UNSPEC  when  the
          source  was  unknown.   When the error originated from the net‐
          work, all IP options (IP_OPTIONS, IP_TTL, etc.) enabled on  the
          socket  and contained in the error packet are passed as control
          messages.  The payload of the packet causing the error  is  re‐
          turned  as  normal  payload.  Note that TCP has no error queue;
          MSG_ERRQUEUE  is  not   permitted   on   SOCK_STREAM   sockets.
          IP_RECVERR  is  valid  for  TCP, but all errors are returned by
          socket function return or SO_ERROR only.

          For raw sockets, IP_RECVERR enables  passing  of  all  received
          ICMP  errors  to the application, otherwise errors are only re‐
          ported on connected sockets

          It sets or retrieves an integer boolean flag.   IP_RECVERR  de‐
          faults to off.

   IP_RECVOPTS (since Linux 2.2)
          Pass  all  incoming IP options to the user in a IP_OPTIONS con‐
          trol message.  The routing header and other options are already
          filled  in  for  the local host.  Not supported for SOCK_STREAM
          sockets.

   IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR (since Linux 2.6.29)
          This boolean option enables the IP_ORIGDSTADDR  ancillary  mes‐
          sage  in  recvmsg(2),  in which the kernel returns the original
          destination address of the datagram being received.  The ancil‐
          lary message contains a struct sockaddr_in.

   IP_RECVTOS (since Linux 2.2)
          If  enabled, the IP_TOS ancillary message is passed with incom‐
          ing packets.  It contains a byte which specifies  the  Type  of
          Service/Precedence field of the packet header.  Expects a bool‐
          ean integer flag.

   IP_RECVTTL (since Linux 2.2)
          When this flag is set, pass a IP_TTL control message  with  the
          time-to-live  field of the received packet as a 32 bit integer.
          Not supported for SOCK_STREAM sockets.

   IP_RETOPTS (since Linux 2.2)
          Identical to IP_RECVOPTS, but returns raw  unprocessed  options
          with  timestamp and route record options not filled in for this
          hop.

   IP_ROUTER_ALERT (since Linux 2.2)
          Pass all to-be forwarded packets with the IP Router  Alert  op‐
          tion  set to this socket.  Valid only for raw sockets.  This is
          useful, for instance, for user-space RSVP daemons.  The  tapped
          packets  are  not forwarded by the kernel; it is the user's re‐
          sponsibility to send them out again.   Socket  binding  is  ig‐
          nored,  such packets are only filtered by protocol.  Expects an
          integer flag.

   IP_TOS (since Linux 1.0)
          Set or receive the Type-Of-Service (TOS)  field  that  is  sent
          with  every IP packet originating from this socket.  It is used
          to prioritize packets on the network.  TOS is  a  byte.   There
          are some standard TOS flags defined: IPTOS_LOWDELAY to minimize
          delays for interactive traffic,  IPTOS_THROUGHPUT  to  optimize
          throughput,  IPTOS_RELIABILITY to optimize for reliability, IP‐
          TOS_MINCOST should be used for "filler data" where slow  trans‐
          mission doesn't matter.  At most one of these TOS values can be
          specified.  Other bits are invalid and shall be cleared.  Linux
          sends  IPTOS_LOWDELAY datagrams first by default, but the exact
          behavior depends on the configured queueing  discipline.   Some
          high-priority  levels  may  require  superuser  privileges (the
          CAP_NET_ADMIN capability).

   IP_TRANSPARENT (since Linux 2.6.24)
          Setting this boolean option  enables  transparent  proxying  on
          this socket.  This socket option allows the calling application
          to bind to a nonlocal IP address and operate both as  a  client
          and  a  server  with the foreign address as the local endpoint.
          NOTE: this requires that routing be set up in a way that  pack‐
          ets  going to the foreign address are routed through the TProxy
          box (i.e., the system hosting the application that employs  the
          IP_TRANSPARENT socket option).  Enabling this socket option re‐
          quires superuser privileges (the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability).

          TProxy redirection with the iptables  TPROXY  target  also  re‐
          quires that this option be set on the redirected socket.

   IP_TTL (since Linux 1.0)
          Set  or retrieve the current time-to-live field that is used in
          every packet sent from this socket.

   IP_UNBLOCK_SOURCE (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
          Unblock previously blocked multicast source.  Returns  EADDRNO‐
          TAVAIL when given source is not being blocked.

          Argument  is  an  ip_mreq_source  structure  as described under
          IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.

</code></pre>
<p>/proc interfaces
       The IP protocol supports a set of /proc interfaces to  configure  some
       global parameters.  The parameters can be accessed by reading or writ‐
       ing files in the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/.  Interfaces  described
       as  Boolean take an integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") mean‐
       ing that the  corresponding  option  is  enabled,  and  a  zero  value
       ("false") meaning that the option is disabled.</p>

<pre><code>   ip_always_defrag (Boolean; since Linux 2.2.13)
          [New  with  kernel 2.2.13; in earlier kernel versions this fea‐
          ture was controlled at compile time by the CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DE‐
          FRAG option; this option is not present in 2.4.x and later]

          When this boolean flag is enabled (not equal 0), incoming frag‐
          ments (parts of IP packets that arose when  some  host  between
          origin  and destination decided that the packets were too large
          and cut them into pieces) will  be  reassembled  (defragmented)
          before being processed, even if they are about to be forwarded.

          Enable  only if running either a firewall that is the sole link
          to your network or a transparent proxy; never ever use it for a
          normal router or host.  Otherwise, fragmented communication can
          be disturbed if the fragments travel over different links.  De‐
          fragmentation also has a large memory and CPU time cost.

          This  is automagically turned on when masquerading or transpar‐
          ent proxying are configured.

   ip_autoconfig (since Linux 2.2 to 2.6.17)
          Not documented.

   ip_default_ttl (integer; default: 64; since Linux 2.2)
          Set the default time-to-live value of outgoing  packets.   This
          can be changed per socket with the IP_TTL option.

   ip_dynaddr (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.0.31)
          Enable  dynamic socket address and masquerading entry rewriting
          on interface address change.  This is useful for dialup  inter‐
          face with changing IP addresses.  0 means no rewriting, 1 turns
          it on and 2 enables verbose mode.

   ip_forward (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 1.2)
          Enable IP forwarding with a boolean flag.  IP forwarding can be
          also set on a per-interface basis.

   ip_local_port_range (since Linux 2.2)
          This  file  contains two integers that define the default local
          port range allocated to sockets that are not  explicitly  bound
          to  a  port number—that is, the range used for ephemeral ports.
          An ephemeral port is allocated to a  socket  in  the  following
          circumstances:

          *  the  port  number in a socket address is specified as 0 when
             calling bind(2);

          *  listen(2) is called on a stream socket that was  not  previ‐
             ously bound;

          *  connect(2)  was  called  on a socket that was not previously
             bound;

          *  sendto(2) is called on a datagram socket that was not previ‐
             ously bound.

          Allocation  of  ephemeral ports starts with the first number in
          ip_local_port_range and ends with the second  number.   If  the
          range of ephemeral ports is exhausted, then the relevant system
          call returns an error (but see BUGS).

          Note that the port range in ip_local_port_range should not con‐
          flict with the ports used by masquerading (although the case is
          handled).  Also, arbitrary choices may cause problems with some
          firewall  packet  filters that make assumptions about the local
          ports in use.  The first number should be at least greater than
          1024,  or better, greater than 4096, to avoid clashes with well
          known ports and to minimize firewall problems.

   ip_no_pmtu_disc (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
          If enabled, don't do Path MTU Discovery for TCP sockets by  de‐
          fault.   Path MTU discovery may fail if misconfigured firewalls
          (that drop all ICMP packets) or misconfigured interfaces (e.g.,
          a  point-to-point  link  where the both ends don't agree on the
          MTU) are on the path.  It is better to fix the  broken  routers
          on  the  path than to turn off Path MTU Discovery globally, be‐
          cause not doing it incurs a high cost to the network.

   ip_nonlocal_bind (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
          If set, allows processes to bind(2) to nonlocal  IP  addresses,
          which can be quite useful, but may break some applications.

   ip6frag_time (integer; default: 30)
          Time in seconds to keep an IPv6 fragment in memory.

   ip6frag_secret_interval (integer; default: 600)
          Regeneration interval (in seconds) of the hash secret (or life‐
          time for the hash secret) for IPv6 fragments.

   ipfrag_high_thresh (integer), ipfrag_low_thresh (integer)
          If   the   amount    of    queued    IP    fragments    reaches
          ipfrag_high_thresh,    the    queue    is    pruned   down   to
          ipfrag_low_thresh.  Contains an  integer  with  the  number  of
          bytes.

<p>ERRORS
       EACCES The user tried to execute an operation  without  the  necessary
              permissions.   These  include:  sending a packet to a broadcast
              address without having the SO_BROADCAST  flag  set;  sending  a
              packet  via a prohibit route; modifying firewall settings with‐
              out superuser privileges (the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability);  bind‐
              ing  to  a  privileged  port  without superuser privileges (the
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability).</p>

<pre><code>   EADDRINUSE
          Tried to bind to an address already in use.

   EADDRNOTAVAIL
          A nonexistent interface was requested or the  requested  source
          address was not local.

   EAGAIN Operation on a nonblocking socket would block.

   EALREADY
          A  connection  operation  on a nonblocking socket is already in
          progress.

   ECONNABORTED
          A connection was closed during an accept(2).

   EHOSTUNREACH
          No valid routing table entry matches the  destination  address.
          This  error  can  be  caused  by  an ICMP message from a remote
          router or for the local routing table.

   EINVAL Invalid argument passed.   For  send  operations  this  can  be
          caused by sending to a blackhole route.

   EISCONN
          connect(2) was called on an already connected socket.

   EMSGSIZE
          Datagram  is  bigger  than  an MTU on the path and it cannot be
          fragmented.

   ENOBUFS, ENOMEM
          Not enough free memory.  This often means that the memory allo‐
          cation  is limited by the socket buffer limits, not by the sys‐
          tem memory, but this is not 100% consistent.

   ENOENT SIOCGSTAMP was called on a socket where no packet arrived.

   ENOPKG A kernel subsystem was not configured.

   ENOPROTOOPT and EOPNOTSUPP
          Invalid socket option passed.

   ENOTCONN
          The operation is defined only on a connected  socket,  but  the
          socket wasn't connected.

   EPERM  User  doesn't have permission to set high priority, change con‐
          figuration, or send signals to the requested process or group.

   EPIPE  The connection was unexpectedly closed  or  shut  down  by  the
          other end.

   ESOCKTNOSUPPORT
          The  socket is not configured or an unknown socket type was re‐
          quested.

   Other errors may be generated by the overlaying protocols; see tcp(7),
   raw(7), udp(7), and socket(7).

<p>NOTES
       IP_FREEBIND, IP_MSFILTER, IP_MTU, IP_MTU_DISCOVER, IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR,
       IP_PKTINFO, IP_RECVERR, IP_ROUTER_ALERT, and IP_TRANSPARENT are Linux-
       specific.</p>

<pre><code>   Be very careful with the SO_BROADCAST option - it is not privileged in
   Linux.  It is easy to overload the network with  careless  broadcasts.
   For  new  application  protocols it is better to use a multicast group
   instead of broadcasting.  Broadcasting is discouraged.

   Some other  BSD  sockets  implementations  provide  IP_RCVDSTADDR  and
   IP_RECVIF socket options to get the destination address and the inter‐
   face of received datagrams.  Linux has the more general IP_PKTINFO for
   the same task.

   Some  BSD  sockets  implementations also provide an IP_RECVTTL option,
   but an ancillary message with type IP_RECVTTL is passed with  the  in‐
   coming  packet.   This  is  different  from  the IP_TTL option used in
   Linux.

   Using the SOL_IP socket options level isn't portable; BSD-based stacks
   use the IPPROTO_IP level.

   INADDR_ANY  (0.0.0.0) and INADDR_BROADCAST (255.255.255.255) are byte-
   order-neutral.
    This means htonl(3) has no effect on them.

</code></pre>
<p>Compatibility
       For  compatibility  with  Linux  2.0,  the  obsolete   socket(AF_INET,
       SOCK_PACKET,  protocol)  syntax is still supported to open a packet(7)
       socket.    This   is   deprecated   and   should   be   replaced    by
       socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, protocol) instead.  The main difference is
       the new sockaddr_ll address structure for generic link layer  informa‐
       tion instead of the old sockaddr_pkt.</p>
<p>BUGS
       There are too many inconsistent error values.</p>

<pre><code>   The error used to diagnose exhaustion of the ephemeral port range dif‐
   fers across the various system calls (connect(2), bind(2),  listen(2),
   sendto(2)) that can assign ephemeral ports.

   The  ioctls  to configure IP-specific interface options and ARP tables
   are not described.

   Receiving  the  original  destination  address  with  MSG_ERRQUEUE  in
   msg_name by recvmsg(2) does not work in some 2.2 kernels.
