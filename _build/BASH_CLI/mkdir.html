<pre><code> mkdir [OPTION]... NAME...

</code></pre>
<p>‘mkdir’ creates each directory NAME in the order given.  It reports
an error if NAME already exists, unless the ‘-p’ option is given and
NAME is a directory.</p>
<p>The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common
options::.</p>
<p>‘-m MODE’
‘--mode=MODE’
     Set the file permission bits of created directories to MODE, which
     uses the same syntax as in ‘chmod’ and uses ‘a=rwx’ (read, write
     and execute allowed for everyone) for the point of the departure.
     *Note File permissions::.</p>

<pre><code> Normally the directory has the desired file mode bits at the moment
 it is created.  As a GNU extension, MODE may also mention special
 mode bits, but in this case there may be a temporary window during
 which the directory exists but its special mode bits are incorrect.
 *Note Directory Setuid and Setgid::, for how the set-user-ID and
 set-group-ID bits of directories are inherited unless overridden in
 this way.

</code></pre>
<p>‘-p’
‘--parents’
     Make any missing parent directories for each argument, setting
     their file permission bits to the umask modified by ‘u+wx’.  Ignore
     existing parent directories, and do not change their file
     permission bits.</p>

<pre><code> To set the file permission bits of any newly-created parent
 directories to a value that includes ‘u+wx’, you can set the umask
 before invoking ‘mkdir’.  For example, if the shell command ‘(umask
 u=rwx,go=rx; mkdir -p P/Q)’ creates the parent ‘P’ it sets the
 parent’s permission bits to ‘u=rwx,go=rx’.  To set a parent’s
 special mode bits as well, you can invoke ‘chmod’ after ‘mkdir’.
 *Note Directory Setuid and Setgid::, for how the set-user-ID and
 set-group-ID bits of newly-created parent directories are
 inherited.

</code></pre>
<p>‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Print a message for each created directory.  This is most useful
     with ‘--parents’.</p>
<p>‘-Z’
‘--context[=CONTEXT]’
     Without a specified CONTEXT, adjust the SELinux security context
     according to the system default type for destination files,
     similarly to the ‘restorecon’ command.  The long form of this
     option with a specific context specified, will set the context for
     newly created files only.  With a specified context, if both
     SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a warning is issued.</p>
<p>An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value
indicates failure.</p>
