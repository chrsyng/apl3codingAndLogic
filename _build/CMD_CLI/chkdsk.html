<h1 id="chkdsk">chkdsk<a class="anchor-link" href="#chkdsk"> </a></h1><p>Checks the file system and file system metadata of a volume for logical and physical errors. If used without parameters, <strong>chkdsk</strong> displays only the status of the volume and does not fix any errors. If used with the <strong>/f</strong>, <strong>/r</strong>, <strong>/x</strong>, or <strong>/b</strong> parameters, it fixes errors on the volume.</p>
<blockquote><p>[!IMPORTANT]
Membership in the local <strong>Administrators</strong> group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to run <strong>chkdsk</strong>. To open a command prompt window as an administrator, right-click <strong>Command prompt</strong> in the Start menu, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Interrupting <strong>chkdsk</strong> is not recommended. However, canceling or interrupting <strong>chkdsk</strong> should not leave the volume any more corrupt than it was before <strong>chkdsk</strong> was run. Rerunning <strong>chkdsk</strong> checks and repairs any remaining corruption on the volume.</p>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
<strong>Note:</strong> Chkdsk can be used only for local disks. The command cannot be used with a local drive letter that has been redirected over the network.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks<a class="anchor-link" href="#Remarks"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><p>Skipping volume checks</p>
<p>The <strong>/i</strong> or <strong>/c</strong> switch reduces the amount of time required to run <strong>chkdsk</strong> by skipping certain volume checks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Checking a locked drive at restart</p>
<p>If you want <strong>chkdsk</strong> to correct disk errors, you cannot have open files on the drive. If files are open, the following error message appears:</p>

<pre><code>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</code></pre>
<p>If you choose to check the drive the next time you restart the computer, <strong>chkdsk</strong> checks the drive and corrects errors automatically when you restart the computer. If the drive partition is a boot partition, <strong>chkdsk</strong> automatically restarts the computer after it checks the drive.</p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>chkntfs /c</strong> command to schedule the volume to be checked the next time the computer is restarted. Use the <strong>fsutil dirty set</strong> command to set the volume's dirty bit (indicating corruption), so that Windows runs <strong>chkdsk</strong> when the computer is restarted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reporting disk errors</p>
<p>You should use <strong>chkdsk</strong> occasionally on FAT and NTFS file systems to check for disk errors. <strong>Chkdsk</strong> examines disk space and disk use and provides a status report specific to each file system. The status report shows errors found in the file system. If you run <strong>chkdsk</strong> without the <strong>/f</strong> parameter on an active partition, it might report spurious errors because it cannot lock the drive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixing logical disk errors</p>
<p><strong>Chkdsk</strong> corrects logical disk errors only if you specify the <strong>/f</strong> parameter. <strong>Chkdsk</strong> must be able to lock the drive to correct errors.</p>
<p>Because repairs on FAT file systems usually change a disk's file allocation table and sometimes cause a loss of data, <strong>chkdsk</strong> might display a confirmation message similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>10 lost allocation units found in 3 chains.  
Convert lost chains to files?</code></pre>
<p>If you press <strong>Y</strong>, Windows saves each lost chain in the root directory as a file with a name in the format File\<nnnn>.chk. When <strong>chkdsk</strong> finishes, you can check these files to see if they contain any data you need. If you press <strong>N</strong>, Windows fixes the disk, but it does not save the contents of the lost allocation units.</p>
<p>If you do not use the <strong>/f</strong> parameter, <strong>chkdsk</strong> displays a message that the file needs to be fixed, but it does not fix any errors.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> on a very large disk or a disk with a very large number of files (for example, millions of files), <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> might take a long time to complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finding physical disk errors</p>
<p>Use the <strong>/r</strong> parameter to find physical disk errors in the file system and attempt to recover data from any affected disk sectors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using <strong>chkdsk</strong> with open files</p>
<p>If you specify the <strong>/f</strong> parameter, <strong>chkdsk</strong> displays an error message if there are open files on the disk. If you do not specify the <strong>/f</strong> parameter and open files exist, <strong>chkdsk</strong> might report lost allocation units on the disk. This could happen if open files have not yet been recorded in the file allocation table. If <strong>chkdsk</strong> reports the loss of a large number of allocation units, consider repairing the disk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using <strong>chkdsk</strong> with Shadow Copies for Shared Folders</p>
<p>Because the Shadow Copies for Shared Folders source volume cannot be locked while Shadow Copies for Shared Folders is enabled, running <strong>chkdsk</strong> against the source volume might report false errors or cause <strong>chkdsk</strong> to unexpectedly quit. You can, however, check shadow copies for errors by running <strong>chkdsk</strong> in Read-only mode (without parameters) to check the Shadow Copies for Shared Folders storage volume.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understanding exit codes</p>
<p>The following table lists the exit codes that <strong>chkdsk</strong> reports after it has finished.</p>
<p>| Exit code |                                                   Description                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     0     |                                              No errors were found.                                               |
|     1     |                                           Errors were found and fixed.                                           |
|     2     | Performed disk cleanup (such as garbage collection) or did not perform cleanup because <strong>/f</strong> was not specified. |
|     3     | Could not check the disk, errors could not be fixed, or errors were not fixed because <strong>/f</strong> was not specified.  |</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>chkdsk</strong> command, with different parameters, is available from the Recovery Console.</li>
<li>On servers that are infrequently restarted, you may want to use the <strong>chkntfs</strong> or the <strong>fsutil dirty query</strong> commands to determine whether the volume's dirty bit is already set before running chkdsk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Examples">Examples<a class="anchor-link" href="#Examples"> </a></h2><p>If you want to check the disk in drive D and have Windows fix errors, type:</p>

<pre><code>chkdsk d: /f</code></pre>
<p>If it encounters errors, <strong>chkdsk</strong> pauses and displays messages. <strong>Chkdsk</strong> finishes by displaying a report that lists the status of the disk. You cannot open any files on the specified drive until <strong>chkdsk</strong> finishes.</p>
<p>To check all files on a FAT disk in the current directory for noncontiguous blocks, type:</p>

<pre><code>chkdsk *.*</code></pre>
<p><strong>Chkdsk</strong> displays a status report, and then lists the files that match the file specifications that have noncontiguous blocks.</p>
